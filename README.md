## Built With

- Ruby

### Prerequisites

- Install Ruby's latest version on your machine

### Install

- Install any code editor you like

# Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Open a terminal or command prompt interface on your machine
- Clone the project on your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/hemant-soni-vst-au4/ruby-linter`
- From your terminal enter the project directory using `cd ruby-linter`

# Instructions

- To check for errors in your css file run the code `ruby bin/main.rb + path to css file`

# How it works
The linter scans through the css file and returns an error with the line number of where that error occurered. **This linter checks for line spacing errors and indentation errors**.
The errors this linter checks for are errors like the following below:

* Bad Code
 `.body{color: blue}` this will result in an error because the linter is expecting a space after the selector `.body`, so it should look like this...
* Good Code
 `.body {color: blue}`

* Bad Code
 `.body {color:blue}` this will result in an error because the linter is expecting a space after the attribute `color:`, so it should look like this...
* Good Code
 `.body {color: blue}`

* Bad Code
 `.blue,p {height: 100px}` this will result in an error because the linter is expecting a space after the selector `.blue` before the next selector `p` so it should look like this...
* Good Code
 `.blue, p {height: 100px}`
